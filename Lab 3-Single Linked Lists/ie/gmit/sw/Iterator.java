/*
 * An Iterator is a structural design pattern that allows us to traverse (loop over)
 * a complex structure in a uniform way. Iterators hide the underlying implementation
 * of a data structure from the user. This iterator can be used in exactly the same 
 * way as the implementations of java.util.Iterator:
 * 
 *     Iterator<Integer> i = list.iterator();
 *     while (i.hasNext()){
 *        int e = i.next();
 *        //Do something with e 
 *     }
 * 
 * The A better approach for traversing a collection is to used a for-in / for-each 
 * loop. The for-in loop uses an iterator under the hood but is simplier to declare
 * and use:
 * 
 *   for (Integer e : list){
 *      //Do something with e 
 *   }
 *
