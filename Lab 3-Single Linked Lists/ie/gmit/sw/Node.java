/*
 * A node acts as a wrapper for one of the elements in the linked list. The
 * class Node is generically typed with an <E> to allow an element of any
 * type to be stored in the list. The element is stored using the instance
 * variable private E data. Each instance of Node has a link to the next item 
 * in the list to form a chain of linked nodes. The links are implemented with 
 * the instance variable private Node<E> next. This creates a single-linked
 * list and allows for iteration and operation in direction only (the forward
 * direction). We can extend this class to implement a doubly-linked list by
 * including an additional instance variable defined as private Node<E> previous
 * and then adding the necessary additional functionality to the class.
